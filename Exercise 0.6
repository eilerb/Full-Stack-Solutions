    Note right of browser: The JS code registers an event handler to handle the form's submit event.
    The event handler immediately calls the method e.preventDefault() to prevent the default handling of form's submit. 
    The default method would send the data to the server and cause a new GET request, which we don't want to happen. 
    Then the event handler creates a new note, adds it to the notes list with the command notes.push(note), 
    rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server.
